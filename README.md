# Ecommerce Linear Regression Project: Driving Strategic Business Decisions ðŸ“ˆ

-----

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging **linear regression** to provide data-driven insights for an e-commerce company facing a critical strategic decision: whether to prioritize investment in their **mobile app experience** or their **website**. By analyzing customer behavior data, the goal is to identify which platform contributes more significantly to customer spending, thereby guiding future development efforts for maximum impact on revenue.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle: Focusing on Mobile App or Website](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website/data). It contains comprehensive information about the e-commerce company's customers, including key metrics related to their engagement with both the mobile app and the website.

**Key Features:**

  * **Avg. Session Length**: Average duration of in-store style advice sessions (likely related to website or app Browse).
  * **Time on App**: Average time a customer spends on the mobile application (in minutes).
  * **Time on Website**: Average time a customer spends on the website (in minutes).
  * **Length of Membership**: The total duration (in years) a customer has been a member of the e-commerce platform.
  * **Yearly Amount Spent**: The continuous target variable, representing the total amount a customer spends per year. (Inferred as the target for a typical e-commerce linear regression analysis.)

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

The core of this project involves building a **Multiple Linear Regression model**. This statistical approach allows us to quantify the relationship between customer spending and various engagement metrics.

The general steps followed include:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Importing the dataset using `pandas` and performing preliminary checks.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between variables using tools like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to understand distributions and potential correlations.
3.  **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen data.
4.  **Model Training**: Training a `LinearRegression` model from `scikit-learn` on the training data.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using relevant regression metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error).
6.  **Coefficient Interpretation**: Analyzing the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the target variable (Yearly Amount Spent). This step is crucial for deriving actionable business recommendations.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings & Strategic Recommendation

The linear regression model's coefficients provide direct insights into the impact of each feature on the `Yearly Amount Spent`. A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in that feature leads to an increase in spending, while a negative coefficient suggests the opposite. The magnitude of the coefficient signifies the strength of this relationship.

Based on the interpretation of these coefficients:

  * If the **coefficient for 'Time on App' is significantly higher and more impactful** than 'Time on Website', it suggests that customers who spend more time on the mobile app tend to spend more money annually.
  * Conversely, if the **coefficient for 'Time on Website' is greater**, it would indicate that website engagement is a stronger driver of annual spending.

While specific coefficient values are not included in the provided output, the project's objective strongly implies that this analysis was performed. **The primary recommendation would be to focus development and marketing efforts on the platform (app or website) that demonstrates a higher positive correlation with the `Yearly Amount Spent`, as indicated by its regression coefficient.** This data-driven approach ensures resources are allocated where they can generate the highest return.

## âœ¨ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of linear regression to solve a practical business problem in the e-commerce sector. By transforming raw customer data into actionable insights, the analysis provides a clear path for the company to make an informed decision regarding its mobile app and website investment strategy. This approach is replicable for various business challenges, highlighting the power of predictive modeling in driving strategic growth.
